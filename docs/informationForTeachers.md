[^1]: Wait times are hard to calculate, and can often be significant dependent on your latency, database server location, among other factors.

[^3]: Homeroom is entirely open-source. This means that the community, or other developers are welcome to [contribute to the project :simple-github:](contributors.md)

[^4]: Homeroom is entirely free software. There are no costs involved with Homeroom, unless you wish to hold data at scale.

[^5]: An internal, managed database system is used within this MIS. You do not have to do anything except pay for the solution, and let them handle the rest. 

[^6]: All MISs contain some form of documentation, but none are to the extent, nor are they as detailed as Homeroom.

[^7]: There is no training required to make use of any MIS, although, all other solutions recommend purchasing their on-site training courses and documentation. Homeroom does not require any form of training.
